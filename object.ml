(* The object table is laid out as follows:

* The base of the object table is in the header
* The object table begins with a block of 31 or 63 default values.
* Following the default property values is the object tree.
* Each entry in the tree is of the same size, and is laid out as follows:
  * 32 or 48 bits of attribute flags
  * the parent, sibling and child object numbers
  * the address of an additional table of variable-sized properties
* object numbers are one-based, so zero is used as the invalid object
