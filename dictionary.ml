(* The table is laid out as follows. First there is a header:

byte giving the number of word separators
the word separators, one byte each
byte giving the number of bytes in each dictionary entry
word giving the number of table entries which follow

Each entry is either 4 (in V1-3) or 6 (otherwise) bytes of zstring data,
followed by enough bytes to make up the size of the dictionary entry. *)
